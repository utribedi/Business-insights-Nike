# Business-insights-Nike

In this notebook I have worked with only the shoes belonging to Nike for solving a potential business use case. With the help of the clustering techniques like K Means and Heirarchial Clustering, I have clustered the shoe models on the basis of their sizes, location, their order and release date and their sale and retail prices.

The result of these clusters or groups of shoes can be of immense use to the company because they can use them to carry out different marketing starategies like deciding which groups of shoes to market together or to decide which shoe models to use as a baseline for the creation of a new shoe model,etc- without having to do an extensive on ground market survey. The actual market survey would cost the company much more in terms of monetary and human resources, therefore making the entire process more efficient.
